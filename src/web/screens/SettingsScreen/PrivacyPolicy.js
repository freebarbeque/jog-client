          Those at credit reference agencies (CRAs). When CRAs receive a search
          from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that
          may be seen by other lenders. They supply to us both public (including
          the electoral register) and shared credit and fraud prevention
          information; and

      we will make checks such as assessing this application for credit and
      verifying identities to prevent and detect crime and money laundering. We
      may also make periodic searches at CRAs and FPAs to manage your account
      with us.

    </p>
    <p>
      Information on applications will be sent to CRAs and will be recorded by
      them.

      If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect or identify
      fraud we will record this and may also pass this information to FPAs and
      other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention.
