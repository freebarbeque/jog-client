                  We may from
                  time to time provide interactive services on our app, for
                  example, chat rooms and bulletin
                  boards (“<b>Interactive Services</b>”).

                <p>
                  Where we do provide any
                  Interactive Service, we will provide clear information to you
                  about the kind of service
                  offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is
                  used (including whether it is
                  human or technical). We will do our best to assess any
                  possible risks for users (and in
                  particular, for children) from third parties when they use any
                  Interactive Service provided
                  on our app, and we will decide in each case whether it is
                  appropriate to use moderation of
                  the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to
                  use) in the light of those risks.
                  However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or
                  moderate any Interactive Service
                  we provide on our app, and we expressly exclude our liability
                  for any loss or damage arising
                  from the use of any interactive service by a user in
                  contravention of our content standards,
                  whether the service is moderated or not.
                </p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>
                  The use of any of our
                  Interactive Services by a minor is subject to the consent of
                  their parent or guardian. We
                  advise parents who permit their children to use an Interactive
                  Service that it is important
                  that they communicate with their children about their safety
                  online, as moderation is not
                  foolproof. Minors who are using any Interactive Service should
                  be made aware of the
                  potential risks to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Where we do
                  moderate an Interactive Service, we will normally provide you
                  with a means of contacting the
                  moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.
